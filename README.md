Upworthless
============

This is a Chrome extension to redirect any link from upworthy that has a youtube video to the source video, so that you don't have to cringe at how bad the writing is.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

To install: 

 * [Download](https://github.com/RichardLitt/upworthless/archive/master.zip) and unpack the zip. 
 * Go to chrome://extensions in the browser, and click "Load unpacked extensions...". 
 * Enable or disable as desired, when desired. This makes it harder than a simple button would. Sorry about that.
 * Surf the web. Enjoy seeing no more upworthy pages, just the content.
